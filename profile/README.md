# QQ Omega

### AI-Powered Scoring Engine for Crypto Assets

**A precision scoring engine that uses AI agents to evaluate crypto assets 0-100 across fundamentals, tokenomics, on-chain data, technicals, and macro trends.**

---

**For investors** who need structured, data-driven analysis instead of hype-based decisions.
**Why now**: AI maturity + on-chain data richness enable institutional-grade, explainable crypto research.
**Why different**: Multi-agent scoring that aggregates diverse analyses into a single, transparent and explainable QQ Score, revealing strengths, weaknesses, and underlying trade-offs.

## What is QQ Omega?

QQ Omega is a high-precision scoring engine that synthesizes **quantitative and qualitative intelligence** into one coherent evaluation of crypto assets.

### The Problem We Solve

- **Too much noise**: News and hype move faster than facts. Manual research can't keep up hundreds of tokens across 100+ chains.
- **Too many traps**: Many token designs reward early insiders and turn retail into exit liquidity. Weak regulation leaves investors exposed.
- **Trust is cheap, proof is rare**: Most claims are hard to verify. You need a consistent method to compare projects on the same basis.

### How It Works

Each crypto asset is evaluated across five categories by specialized **AI agent swarms**:

| Category         | What It Measures                                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fundamentals** | Team, product maturity, competitive moat, governance, security |
| **Tokenomics**   | Utility, inflation/deflation, unlock schedules, distribution   |
| **On-Chain**     | TVL, volume, holder distribution, whale flows                  |
| **Technicals**   | Price action, momentum, support/resistance, volatility         |
| **Macro**        | Market regime, risk-on/risk-off environment                    |

Their analyses aggregate into a **Global QQ Score** (0-100) that updates automatically as new data unfolds.

**Multi-timeframe scoring**: Each asset is scored across four horizons (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly) with different weights per timeframe. Short-term evaluations emphasize on-chain and technicals, while long-term assessments prioritize fundamentals and tokenomics.

## The $QQ Token

### Overview

The $QQ token is the access layer for QQ Omega.

| Detail           | Value                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain**        | Solana (6,000 QQ) + Base (4,000 QQ)                        |
| **Total Supply** | 10,000 QQ (fixed, no inflation)                            |
| **Launch**       | Meteora DBC stealth launch (Solana) + Uniswap v3 LP (Base) |
| **Distribution** | No private sale. See breakdown below                       |

### Access

**Hold 1 $QQ** to unlock the live dashboard with real-time scores, rankings, and all features.

### Why the Token Exists

1. **Access control**: On-chain verification determines dashboard access.
2. **Value capture**: As QQ Omega grows, token utility grows with it.
3. **Fair launch**: No private sale, no VC rounds. Public launch via Meteora DBC on Solana. Team and partnership allocations are disclosed in the distribution breakdown below.

### Token Distribution

| Allocation                     | Amount           | Share |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----: |
| Meteora DBC Stealth Launch     | 2,600 QQ (SOL)   |   26% |
| LP on Solana (Meteora DAMM v2) | 2,400 QQ (SOL)   |   24% |
| LP on Base (Uniswap v3)        | 2,400 QQ (Base)  |   24% |
| QQ Community Airdrop           | 1,500 QQ (mixed) |   15% |
| Virtuals Ecosystem Airdrop     | 600 QQ (Base)    |    6% |
| Core Contributors              | 400 QQ (mixed)   |    4% |
| Strategic Partnerships         | 100 QQ (mixed)   |    1% |

### Burn & Protocol-Owned Liquidity

12% of LP fees fund a **buyback-and-burn** mechanism. 17% of LP fees grow **Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL)** across both chains. Target: reduce total supply by at least 50% over time. All operations are executed monthly with on-chain proofs.

## FAQ

**Q: Is the code open-source?**
A: No. Architecture and API specs are documented publicly; scoring algorithms are proprietary.

**Q: When will the dashboard be available?**
A: Target Q1-Q2 2026. Token-gated access requires holding 1 $QQ.

**Q: How is token holding verified?**
A: On-chain verification. Your wallet balance determines access.

**Q: Where can I buy $QQ?**
A: $QQ launched via Meteora DBC on Solana (graduates to DAMM v2) with liquidity also on Base via Uniswap v3.

**Q: How many tokens are tracked?**
A: The initial focus is full, deep coverage of major assets (e.g. Top 100 by evaluation). Coverage then expands progressively, adding new tokens based on market relevance, community surveys, and direct submissions.
