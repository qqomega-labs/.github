# QQ Omega

### AI-Powered Scoring Engine for Crypto Assets

**A precision scoring engine that uses AI agents to evaluate crypto assets 0-100 across fundamentals, tokenomics, on-chain data, technicals, and macro trends.**

---

**For investors** who need structured, data-driven analysis instead of hype-based decisions.
**Why now**: AI maturity + on-chain data richness enable institutional-grade, explainable crypto research.
**Why different**: Multi-timeframe scoring with transparent AI reasoning not black-box signals.

## What is QQ Omega?

QQ Omega is a high-precision scoring engine that synthesizes **quantitative and qualitative intelligence** into one coherent evaluation of crypto assets.

### The Problem We Solve

- **Too much noise**: News and hype move faster than facts. Manual research can't keep up with 10,000+ tokens across 100+ chains.
- **Too many traps**: Many token designs reward early insiders and turn retail into exit liquidity. Weak regulation leaves investors exposed.
- **Trust is cheap, proof is rare**: Most claims are hard to verify. You need a consistent method to compare projects on the same basis.

### How It Works

Each crypto asset is evaluated across five categories by specialized **AI agent swarms**:

| Category         | What It Measures                                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fundamentals** | Team, product maturity, competitive moat, governance, security |
| **Tokenomics**   | Utility, inflation/deflation, unlock schedules, distribution   |
| **On-Chain**     | TVL, volume, holder distribution, whale flows                  |
| **Technicals**   | Price action, momentum, support/resistance, volatility         |
| **Macro**        | Market regime, risk-on/risk-off environment                    |

Their analyses aggregate into a **Global QQ Score** (0-100) that updates automatically as new data unfolds.

**Multi-timeframe scoring**: Different weights apply per investment horizon short-term evaluations emphasize on-chain and technicals, while long-term assessments prioritize fundamentals and tokenomics.

## The $QQ Token

### Overview

The $QQ token is the access layer for QQ Omega.

| Detail           | Value                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain**        | Base                                         |
| **Max Supply**   | 1,000,000,000 (fixed, no inflation)          |
| **Launch**       | Virtuals Protocol Pegasus (fair launch)      |
| **Distribution** | No private sale, no preferential allocations |

### Access

**Hold 100,000 $QQ** to unlock the live dashboard with real-time scores, rankings, and all features.

### Why the Token Exists

1. **Access control**: On-chain verification determines dashboard access no accounts, no middlemen.
2. **Value capture**: As QQ Omega grows, token utility grows with it.
3. **Fair distribution**: Everyone enters on the same terms. No VCs got in cheaper than you.

## FAQ

**Q: Is the code open-source?**
A: No. Architecture and API specs are documented publicly; scoring algorithms are proprietary.

**Q: When will the dashboard be available?**
A: Target Q1-Q2 2026. Token-gated access requires holding 100,000 $QQ.

**Q: How is token holding verified?**
A: On-chain verification. Your wallet balance determines access.

**Q: Where can I buy $QQ?**
A: Launched via Virtuals Protocol Pegasus on Base. Graduates to Uniswap v2 after threshold.

## Disclaimer

**Project Status**: Token live, product in active development.

**Risk**: $QQ is a utility token for dashboard access. This is a build-in-public project software development involves uncertainty.
